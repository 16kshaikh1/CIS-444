### CIS 444 Reading Assignment #1: Intro to Swift 

### Objective

The goal of our first reading assignment is to start to get an understanding of the programming language Swift.
This week covers basic stuff like variables and control flow, but also more trickier topics like Optionals, manipulating Strings and the syntax for defining classes and struct and their methods and properties.

Read all of the material referenced here by the start of Lecture 3. Set aside sufficient
time because thereâ€™s quite a bit of reading here. You will only have reading assignments
in the first few weeks of this course. It's worth getting all the reading out of the way for this course.  

If you don't understand a concept in the documentation I have provide below, don't panic or give up. Read it again, slow down, take notes as you go. If you're still stuck utilize google  and search the topic you're having difficulty grasping. There are  endless sources and tutorials online to help communicate the concepts in a different way. Bring any extra questions you might have to class. 


## Materials

* The reading in this course comes from two online documents: [Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/#) and the [Swift API Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
